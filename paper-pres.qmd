## xpts {.smaller}

::: incremental

- Outdated Design: Born in the 1980s, its architecture is incompatible with modern standards.

- Restrictive Naming: Limits variable names to 8 characters and labels to 40.

- Language Barrier: Supports only US ASCII, hindering international character sets.

- Disjointed Metadata: Metadata is stored separately, leading to potential data-meaning mismatches.

- Inefficient Storage: Wastes space through blank padding and lacks data compression.
:::

## datasetjson {.smaller}

::: incremental

- CDISC Standard: Dataset-JSON is a CDISC standard for representing clinical tabular datasets using JSON.

- Modern Data Exchange: Designed for interoperability, supporting regulatory submissions and API-based data sharing.

- Machine-Readable Metadata: Carries explicit, machine-readable dataset metadata for improved clarity and validation.

- Flexible Data Handling: Enables transport of rows, column metadata, and supports streaming for large datasets (NDJSON).

- Regulatory Momentum: Aligns with FDA's evolving stance on electronic study data submission and industry collaboration.

:::

## Why not another format? {.smaller}

::: incremental
- Embedded Metadata: Contains all variable and CDISC-specific metadata directly within the file.

- Human-Readable & Auditable: Text-based JSON allows for easy review, comparison, and validation.

- Version Control Friendly: Integrates seamlessly with Git and standard diff tools.

- Universal Parsing: Supported by JSON parsers in nearly all programming languages, lowering implementation hurdles.

- Regulatory Transparency: Prioritizes readability and auditability, crucial for regulatory review contexts.

## R Submissions to FDA Working Group {.smaller}

::: incremental

- Regulatory Viability: Demonstrating that open-source, R-based submissions meet regulatory expectations.

- Transparency: Promoting full transparency by making all submission artifacts (data, code, documentation) available.

- Current Facilitation: Providing open examples to ease R-based regulatory submissions today.

- Future Influence: Shaping future industry and agency decisions on submission systems and processes.

- Proven Success: Demonstrating reproducible workflows, eCTD-style packaging, and securing FDA recognition.

:::

## Pilot 5 {.smaller}

- Dataset-JSON Submission: Aims to deliver a publicly accessible R-based submission package using Dataset-JSON.

- R-based ADaM Generation: Expands on prior pilots by generating ADaM datasets directly in R.

- Evolution from Prior Pilots: Builds on Pilot 1 (R-based tables/figures) and Pilot 3 (R-generated ADaM as XPT).

- XPT to Dataset-JSON Conversion: Focused on converting all XPT files in the submission package to Dataset-JSON.

- Process-Oriented: Emphasizes investigating the submission process and Dataset-JSON integration over content volume.

## Pilot 5 Success {.smaller}

- Submission sent to FDA in late Fall of 2025

- Re-submission needed to remove unhelpful code

- Re-submitted in early January and awaiting feedback.

## Conclusion {.smaller}

- Dataset-JSON Viability: Demonstrates Dataset-JSON as a realistic alternative transport format for submissions.

- Reproducibility Maintained: Confirms reproducibility and reviewability are maintained with Dataset-JSON.

- Equivalent to XPT: Shows Dataset-JSON supports scientific intent and reproducibility expectations of XPT.

- Transparent Approach: Achieved through transparent derivation code, explicit metadata, and reviewer-oriented packaging.

- Modern Alignment: Integrates modern open-source data workflows while upholding regulatory standards.
